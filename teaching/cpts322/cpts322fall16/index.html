<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Course description:</span></p>
<p class="c3">
Software engineering is a subject that concerns the holistic process of software development, distilling the common 
principles for constructing and maintaining quality software products independent of particular programming languages 
used. The core of this subject is characteristics of a lifecycle model that covers different phases of software development 
process, including requirement analysis, software design, implementation, testing and validation, evolution and maintenance. 
Here the principles of software engineering are instructed through two complementary courses, Software Engineering I and 
Software Engineering II (CptS 422). Beyond an introduction to the holistic software process at first, this course will mainly 
focus on the first two phases, requirement analysis and design, covering software specification (including formal methods), 
prototyping, and design (including object-oriented and functional paradigms).
</p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Goals:</span></p>
<p class="c3">
The core content is the overall software process, requirement analysis , specification, design, project management, 
quality assurance, and risk management. Students will also learn valuable skills necessary for software engineering 
practices, including using version control system, creating project plan, soliciting requirement, creating design, 
and practicing validation and verification activities. Students will participate in a semester long project to give 
them hands-on experience with software engineering principles. In the project students will practice principles and 
techniques introduced in the class, and follow software process models in development efforts. The objective is to 
experience a particular method for the systematic development of large software systems. Students will learn what it 
takes to build real software products.</p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Prerequisites:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Students taking this course are expected to have already taken CptS 222 or CptS 223 with a grade 
C or better (NO concurrent enrollment). Through these prerequisite courses, students should have gained a solid 
background in data structures and object-oriented programming (C/C++ or Java).</span></p><p class="c3"></p>

<p class="c3">
<span class="c4">Homework/project policies:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Homework assignments usually require 1-2 weeks to complete. Homework assignments with their respective 
due date will be announced in class and posted on this course website. You are encouraged to take advantage 
of office hours if you have questions for homework assignments. Unless posted, homework and project documents shall be edited 
and submitted electronically.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="c3">Acceptable file formats include: Microsoft word, PowerPoint, PDF, Open Document Format, Postscript, and 
for graphics or scanned documents, GIF or JPEG.</span></li>
<li><span class="c3">Homework shall be submitted electronically via the <a href="https://learn.wsu.edu/">Blackboard </a>
system.</span></li>
<li><span class="c3">Homework submission deadline is the midnight of its posted due date.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c3"><span>The progress of semester-long project will be measured by milestones. The objectives, requirements, and 
deadline of each milestone will be posted in the project section. At each milestone, you may be required to submit a written 
report, code, or test cases to demonstrate your progress.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Late penalty is a flat 10% point deduction. Late assignments may be turned up to one week after the original 
due date and an advanced notice must be given to the instructor beforehand for the late submission. No homework will be accepted 
after its due day without advanced notice or special permission from the instructor.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Classroom policies:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Class attendance is strongly encouraged for the best understanding of the course materials as well as for 
enhancing communication skills with other students and benefiting from in-class discussions. In addition, students are expected 
to maintain a professional and respectful classroom environment, for which students are suggested to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="c3">Silence personal electronics (non-disruptive ones may be used during class)</span></li>
<li><span class="c3">Arrive on time and attend the entire class session</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Academic integrity / Honor code:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>The fundamental requirement for all student work in this class is: Unless otherwise explicitly permitted by the 
instructor, all work you turn in must be your own. Any instance of academic dishonesty, as defined in the WSU Student Handbook, in 
this class will be dealt with severely (typically by failing the class) and reported to the WSU Office of Student Conduct. Note in 
particular that it is dishonest not only to copy another student&#39;s work, but to permit another student to copy yours. 
Nevertheless, realizing that students can assist each other in understanding general course material, there are limited ways in 
which student collaboration is permitted:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="c3">You may communicate verbally with another student, as long as you do not communicate the answer or the other 
content of what you are going to turn in, whether code, mathematics, and/or text. A good way to work in this regard is for 
the student providing help to ask leading questions of the student needing help, letting them arrive at 
the answer themselves.</span></li>
<li><span class="c3">You may draw diagrams and such on a whiteboard, chalkboard, or piece of blank paper to illustrate the 
verbal points made in (1), as long as you do not write what you are going to turn in.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c3"><span>It will be up to the discretions of the grader (if applicable) and instructor to determine if any assignment 
shows evidence of collaboration beyond these limits. Any attempt to circumvent the spirit of these rules will be treated as a 
violation of the fundamental requirement. If you are in doubt, do not give help to or request it from another student: That&#39;s 
what office hours are for. Information on WSU Academic Integrity can be found at 
<a class="c3" href="https://www.academicintegrity.wsu.edu/">www.academicintegrity.wsu.edu</a></span><span>&nbsp;and 
<a class="c3" href="https://conduct.wsu.edu/">conduct.wsu.edu</a>, and the WSU Honor code is on 
<a class="c3" href="https://provost.wsu.edu/tag/wsu-honor-code">https://provost.wsu.edu/tag/wsu-honor-code/.</a>
Please also read <a class="c3" href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/Misc/academic-integrity.html">
the EECS Academic Integrity Policy</a> carefully. Use these resources to ensure that you do not inadvertently violate 
WSU&#39;s standard of conduct.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Accommodations:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Reasonable accommodations are available for students who have a documented disability. Classroom 
accommodation forms are available through the Access Center (Washington Building 217; 509-335-3417). If you have a disability and 
need accommodations to fully participate in this class, please either visit or call the Access Center (Washington Building 217; 
509-335-3417) to schedule an appointment with an Access Advisor. All accommodations MUST be approved through the Access Center. 
For more information, consult the webpage <a class="c3" 
href="http://accesscenter.wsu.edu/">http://accesscenter.wsu.edu</a> or email at Access.Center@wsu.edu.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c4">Safety information:</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>The <a href="http://safetyplan.wsu.edu/">Campus Safety Plan</a> contains a comprehensive listing of 
university policies, procedures, statistics, and information relating to campus safety. The 
<a href="http://oem.wsu.edu/">University Emergency Management</a> provides campus safety and emergency information. 
The <a href="http://alert.wsu.edu/">University Emergency Alert</a> provides information about emergencies and 
communication resources WSU will use to provide warning and notification during emergencies.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c3"><a href="https://faculty.wsu.edu/classroom-safety/">Classroom Safety</a> is also of paramount 
importance at Washington State University, and is the shared responsibility of the entire campus population. WSU urges 
students to follow the &quot;Alert, Assess, Act&quot; protocol for all types of emergencies and the 
<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cirg/active-shooter-and-mass-casualty-incidents/run-hide-fight-video/">
&quot;Run, Hide, Fight&quot;</a> response for an active shooter incident. Remain ALERT (through direct observation or 
emergency notification), ASSESS your specific situation, and act in most appropriate way to assure your own safety (and the 
safety of others if you are able). Please sign up for emergency alerts on your account at MyWSU.</span></p>
