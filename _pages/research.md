## Research overview 

Research in the group currently focuses on the <em>security and other quality aspects of mobile apps, distributed systems, and multi-language software</em>, primarily through developing and applying scalable and cost-effective program analysis techniques in synergy with data-driven (especially deep learning) approaches. 

---

## Current research projects

* vulnerability discovery from indutry-scale distributed software systems via scalable program analysis techniques.

* data quality problems in learning deep code models for software vulnerability analysis (e.g., leveraging generative models for automated, massive generation of realistic data samples to support training of powerful, generalizable DL code models)

* autonomic information security defense in adversarial and dynamic environments mainly through efficient system profiling and (deep) reinforcement learning, and

* program analysis and run-time support for testing and validation of multi-language software systems, and their applications to discovering and diagnosing correctness bugs and security vulnerabilities across (programming) languages.
