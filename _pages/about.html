Bio: I am an assistant professor in the <a href="http://eecs.wsu.edu/">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)</a> at <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/"> Washington State University, Pullman. I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at Virginia Tech under the supervision of <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ryder/">Dr. Barbara Ryder</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/danfeng/">Dr. Daphne Yao</a> on program analysis and its applications in software security. I received my Ph.D. in 2015 from the <a href="http://cse.nd.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://nd.edu">University of Notre Dame</a>, where I worked on source-code analyses, mostly program dependence analysis, for software evolution and reliability, advised by <a href="http://cse.nd.edu/~dthain">Dr. Douglas Thain</a> and Dr. Raul Santelices. Previously, I did my Masters in Computer Science researching graphics and visaulization and worked for over two years as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu Inc</a>. I am a National Certified Software System Analyst and a National Certified Senior Software Engineer of China.

<b>For Prospective Students:</b> 
I am looking for self-motivated and qualified PhD students who are interested in software engineering research, with a focus on program analysis and its applications for the reliability and security of evolving software systems (especially mobile and distributed software) Please email me with your CV if interested. 

Multiple fully funded RA positions are available starting Spring 2022 or Fall 2022 for research on software/system security using program analysis and machine/deep learning techniques. Candidates are expected to be highly self-motivated, strong at application/system programming, and fluent in English (written and oral) communication. Background/experience on software engineering, code analysis, and software/systems security is preferable but not mandatory. If you are interested, please email me with your CV (including your research/project experience, publications if any, technical/programming skills, test scores, and contact info for referees) and a statement of motivation and goals for research. 

Two funded REU student openings are available during Fall 2021 through Summer 2022. If you are an undergrad interested in our software engineering and security research, please send me an email with your resume. If you are at WSU, you may also stop by my office for a chat.

<b>Research Interests:</b>
My research generally lies in software engineering, program analysis, software reliability, software evolution, and software security, with a current focus on adaptive/data-driven static and dynamic analysis for security defense and performance optimizations of mobile applications and large-scale distributed software systems (especially those developed in multiple programming languages). The main goal of my research is to develop scalable and cost-effective techniques and tools that practically improve the productivity of software developers and the quality of real-world software.
